    Added extra variables to Neutron role for Availability Zones configuration:

      * ``neutron_default_availability_zones`` - defines a list of AZs where
        l3/dhcp agents or OVN routers/ports will be scheduled to when hint is
        not provided in a request to Neutron API.
      * ``neutron_availability_zone`` - Availability Zone of the current
        component. It is recommended to leverage group/host_vars for setting
        this variable.
        For OVN this variable can contain multiple values spearated by colon.
