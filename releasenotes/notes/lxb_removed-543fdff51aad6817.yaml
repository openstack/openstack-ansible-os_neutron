upgrade:
  - |
    A ``ml2.lxb`` (linuxbridge) plugin has been removed from Neutron for this release and
    can not be used anymore. Please, ensure migrating to supported Neutron driver
    before proceeding with the upgrade to this OpenStack version.
    Unfortunatelly, there is no currently existing automation for such migration.
    You can reffer to the blog post `Migrating from LinuxBridge to OVN <https://www.jimmdenton.com/migrating-lxb-to-ovn/>`_
    to learn more on how such migrations were achieved previously.
deprecations:
  - |
    Previously marked as experimental by Neutron linuxbridge (``ml2.lxb``) plugin
    has been removed from the codebase.
    Please make sure that you are using supported driver before upgrade.
