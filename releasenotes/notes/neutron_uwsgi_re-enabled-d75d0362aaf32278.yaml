upgrade:
  - |
    uWSGI has been re-enabled by default for Neutron one more time. With that
    new services are introduced which should ensure adequate functionality of
    Neutron when uWSGI is being used.

      - ``neutron-periodic-workers`` service is enabled for all drivers when
        WSGI is being used. It runs along with previously existing
        ``neutron-rpc-server``

      - ``neutron-ovn-maintenance-worker`` service is added only if `ml2.ovn`
        is being used as ``neutron_plugin_type``. The service will be enabled
        and running only when WSGI is used for Neutron ``neutron_use_uwsgi`` is
        set to `True`

  - |
    If you are using Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish and ``install_method: distro``
    please make sure to disable ``neutron_use_uwsgi`` as required binaries for
    this mode to work are missing from packages for this distro.
fixes:
  - |
    Issues with uWSGI mode for Neutron has been addressed and uWSGI be used
    for the service.
