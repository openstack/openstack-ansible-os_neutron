upgrade:
  - |
    Variable ``networking_ovn_bgp_install_branch`` has been renamed to
    ``networking_ovn_bgp_git_install_branch`` in order to match existing
    naming convention.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixes SHA pinning and installation of ``ovn-bgp-agent``, as SHA pinning
    and role were using different variable names.
