    Fixed issue where neutron-metadata-agent and neutron-dhcp-agent were
    started on network_hosts for OVN scenario along with
    neutron-ovn-metadata-agent. These services will be disabled and masked
    for existing environments. Manual clean-up of systemd services and
    correpsonsive neutron agents is still needed.
    New deployments won't have these services deployed from the beginning.
