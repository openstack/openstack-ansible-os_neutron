    Changed a default value for a ``neutron_default_availability_zones``
    variable. From now on role will gather defined ``neutron_availability_zone``
    across all hosts (which defaults to `nova`) and attempt to schedule
    on all available Availability Zones by default.
    Change of the default should not alter behaviour for single-AZ setups.
