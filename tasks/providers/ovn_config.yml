# NOTE(noonedeapdunk): ovs 3.1 installed by rdo now has a bug, where
#                      `ovs-vsctl add` acts exactly as `set` and resets hostname
#                      so we fully disable functionality of managing hostnames
#                      Ubuntu in it's place don't run this vulnerable version and
#                      passes --no-record-hostname in systemd unit file already
